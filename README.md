# Computational-Thinking-Project
For this project, I worked in a group of myself and 2 others. For this project we used python to help evaluate what metrics best correlate to running back success in the nfl. We used a website called playerprofiler to use metrics like height, weight, draft capital, burst score, and 40 time and used a code in python to help generate a score for each starting running back in the NFL, to determine which one is the most prominent in the best running backs and which ones stood out as worse with the lower end running backs. This tool could be useful for scouting running backs out of college to see which ones excel with certain metrics that the best running backs in the league also exceled at during their time in college. Overall, this was a fun project to do and my group and I learned a lot about coding.
